# Housing Price Predictor  

A machine learning project that predicts housing prices using Python, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost.  

## Features  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering with Pandas  
- Regression models: Random Forest vs. XGBoost  
- Visualization of results with Matplotlib  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/Sarim-h191/housing-price-predictor.git  
   cd housing-price-predictor  

2. Install dependencies:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  

3. Open and run the notebook:  
   jupyter notebook housing_price_predictor.ipynb  

## Results  
- XGBoost achieved higher accuracy than baseline linear models  
- Feature importance plots highlight top predictors of housing prices
